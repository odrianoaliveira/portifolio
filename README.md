# 🧠 Adriano Oliveira – Distributed Systems Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio. Here, you'll find showcase projects, benchmarks, technical writings, and architecture artifacts aligned with my specialization in **low-latency distributed systems**.

This portfolio demonstrates my work as a Staff-level Backend Engineer with deep expertise in:
- Event-driven architecture (Kafka, CQRS)
- High-throughput, low-latency microservices (gRPC, Kotlin, Go)
- Observability and SLO engineering (P99, tracing, OpenTelemetry)

Each folder contains a focused topic that reflects the real-world design and operation of distributed systems.

## 📁 Projects
- [`low-latency-ledger`](./low-latency-ledger): CQRS + Kafka-based ledger architecture in Kotlin

## 📚 Blog
[Blog](./blog/): techincal article, lessons learned, benchmarks, system design, architecutre decisions, etc.
