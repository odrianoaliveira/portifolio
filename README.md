# 🧠 Portfolio

Welcome to my technical portfolio.
Here, you'll find showcase projects, benchmarks, technical writings, and architecture artifacts aligned with my background.

This portfolio demonstrates my work as a Software Engineer with deep expertise in:
- Event-driven architecture
- High-throughput, low-latency services (gRPC, Java, Kotlin, Go)
- Observability and SLO engineering (P99, tracing, OpenTelemetry)

Each folder contains a focused topic that reflects the real-world design and operation of distributed systems.

## 📁 Projects
- [`low-latency-ledger`](./low-latency-ledger): CQRS + Kafka-based ledger architecture in Kotlin

## 📚 Blog
[Blog](./blog/): technical article, lessons learned, benchmarks, system design, architecture decisions, etc.
